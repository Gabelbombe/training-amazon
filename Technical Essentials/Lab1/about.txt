AWS Technical Essentials - Lab 1 - Amazon S3

Lab Description: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable object storage service designed for the Internet. In this lab you will create an Amazon S3 bucket and configure access 
logging. You will then upload an object and manage its permissions. When this is done, you can access the object via a web browser. You will have a chance to modify the object metadata, encrypt 
objects with Server Side Encryption, create folders, apply bucket- wide security with a bucket policy, and enable lifecycle policies to archive and delete logs.
