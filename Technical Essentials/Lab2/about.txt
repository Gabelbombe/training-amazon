AWS Technical Essentials - Lab 2 - Amazon EC2

Lab Description: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new 
server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity as your computing requirements change. In this lab you will launch an Amazon EC2 instance, connect to the instance, and create 
Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes.
